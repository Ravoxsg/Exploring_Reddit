They are very good with children.' It can even be argued that the same traits that make the pit bull so aggressive toward other dogs are what make it so nice to humans. \u201cThere are a lot of pit bulls these days who are licensed therapy dogs,' the writer Vicki Hearne points out. 'Their stability and resoluteness make them excellent for work with people who might not like a more bouncy, flibbertigibbet sort of dog. When pit bulls set out to provide comfort, they are as resolute as they are when they fight, but what they are resolute about is being gentle. And, because they are fearless, they can be gentle with anybody.'\r\n\r\nThe author made an argument against the pit bull breed in the beginning of the article and then blew it apart with some of the text quoted above. His point was that pit bulls were not dangerous enough to ban, the image of the evil pit bull was just an unfounded sterotype.

A much closer analogy would be when the cops pay more attention to a pit bull running loose than to a Labrador retriever running loose. And is that really so morally reprehensible or pragmatically ineffectual?\r\n\r\nBut if you go look up the data on people killed by dogs, you find that of the 238 deaths from 1979-1998 for which the breed of dog is known, 66 were due to pit bull-type breeds (along with 10 people killed by part-pit bull mixed breed dogs). Pure-bred Rottweilers were far back in second place with 39 kills and pure-bred German Shepherds in third with 17. Unfortunately, we don't have terribly good data on the number of dogs by breed, but certainly the Labrador retriever is vastly more common than all the various pit bull breeds combined, yet only one person in those two decades was killed by a pure bred Labrador (and four by part Labradors). \r\n\r\nMoreover, the danger to children (who comprise about 70% of dog fatalities) from pit bulls relative to Labradors is even worse than these numbers suggest because sensible dog owners buy dog breeds based on likely exposure to children. If you have a small child, you are much more likely to buy a Labrador to be his pet rather than a pit bull. \r\n\r\nGladwell misses the salient point about bulldog breeds -- they tend to be wonderfully loyal to their owners, but precisely because they are so monogamous in their loyalties, they can be dangerous to others, such as your child's friends, for example, if they get into a fight with your child. In contrast, Labradors are promiscuously friendly, so you don't have to worry about your Lab eating a guest who gets out of hand at your kid's birthday party.\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_15t1","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt;You miss the point. He's saying the book has little value precisely because the author more or less purposefully (through his selection criteria) created a caricature of America.\r\n\r\nNo. His point is that he thinks it is mocking Americans and there's no point for a book that openly mocks Americans to be written in English. This is despite the fact that his description of the text made it look a lot like Alistaire Cooke's [Letters from America](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/default.stm) or even his own Prarie Home Companion radio broadcast. The only reasons I can imagine he wouldn't think the book should be translated into English would be he's pandering to anti-French sentiment or he simply forgot about the rest of the English speaking world. Considering the fact that he does Honda commercials in Britain, I'm guessing he's pandering.\r\n\r\n&gt;As for the obesity issue, there are two things wrong with your statement. One, Keillor is 64 years old. A cursory search on the web shows that about 60-75 percent of men his age are overweight.\r\n\r\nSo what?\r\n\r\n&gt; Two, yes, he's taking issue with the notion that all Americans are fat, because it's simply not true.\r\n\r\nI haven't read the book, but nowhere in the review did he say it claims all Americans are fat. Although 60-75% is a significant majority.\r\n\r\nTake into consideration that the fact that Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy is directly competing with Keillor through this book.

Oh sure, maybe if the language has enough libraries - i.e. with the unaddressed 'library cheat' you could. \r\n\r\nWith almost any language, you regularly refer to implementations, be it the VM's code, a dynamically linked library or somesuch. With compiled language, you usually compile a considerable part of implementation into your executable, for speed - and also there's static linking, which are usually used to have something not break when your set of installed libraries isn't quite the same, a lesser evil in the imperfect environment that is 'pick a computer, any computer'. Of course, by just the size measure that would make it suck.\r\n\r\nThen again, consider for example centericq; I disassembled it once because I could not get my head around why the executble alone was 8MB. It turned out to mostly be compiled templates, that were probably mostly never used. Its creators probably didn't want to rewrite everything\r\nwithout templates, and it worked. That sort of attitude isn't necessarily bad, but it does bloat things beyond what is necessary.\r\n\r\nThen consider MenuetOS - 1.4MB, and is a complete graphical operating system with networking and a few games. Sure, it's an extreme case because it's written in assembly. But on the other hand, why can't everything compile that well? GCC uses RTL, which I suppose adds overhead by translation to x86 being imperfect, but still.\r\n\r\nThe fact that identical functionality can be implemented in code many, *many* times as big/small is not only bloat, it's regularly an indication of the bored \"add bits of code to this IDE here until they seem to work\" attitude I fear goes into many things.\r\n\r\nHmm.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473820877,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"c16jr","parent_id":"t1_c16ga","author":"scarfboy","author_flair_text":null}

Up until a few years ago, I had a T1 provided by my then-employer (sweeeet), but then they decided they wanted to charge me $200/month for the local loop (not so sweet).  That's pretty cheap for a T1, but not cheap enough to make it a justifiable expense just for the upstream bandwidth and other advantages over DSL or cable.  So I used a cable modem for a few months as a quick fallback, then got DSL.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty decent.  Only went down a couple of times during the ~3 years we had it, was fast as the T1 on downstream, and we could cope with the upstream well enough that we didn't move our web sites off of our server at home.\r\n\r\nBut when we moved recently, and the DSL was moved, things went south quick.  For several weeks it didn't work at all.  Then they sent somebody out from Covad and he did some rewiring, and it sort of worked, for a little while (a few days).  Then I started having to reset the modem every day, and it was slowwww when it was up.\r\n\r\nEventually we found out that we were just too far from the CO to get reliable or fast service.  So I relunctly investigated cable modem service.  I found out that our local provider, Charter, has a business service with 3Mbps downstream (twice what we got with DSL) and 384Kbps upstream (same as what we got with DSL), with static IP, that you can run servers on freely, for $75/mo.  And you can get it in your home if you know who and how to ask.\r\n\r\nThis is not an endorsement, but the service works well enough for me.  I've only been using it for a few months, though.\r\n\r\nThe point is, though, that the LECs (or at least SBC - now called AT&amp;T again) need to get their acts together if they want to beat out the cable companies.  If they can't provide DSL to somebody living in a house in a very affluent medium-density neighborhood, in a major suburb of a significant city, that is not in any way semi-rural (\"out in the boonies\"), then they are doing something wrong in my book.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_16ss","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473820894,"distinguished":null,"author":"spif","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"c17fu","parent_id":"t1_c177g"}

You need to go no further than his monetary blatherings to realize this kid believes what he saw on X-files.\r\n\r\nA few reasons why the administration won't roll divisions into Iran anytime soon:\r\n1) Domestically, they couldn't sell it unless an ayatollah was filmed sitting on some newly-made nukes on CNN with a promise to drop them on American cities. Folks may not have noticed, but domestic approval ratings for the president, and in particular, the Iraq war, are quite low.\r\n\r\n2) Iraq is a country of about 26m people, and are split into different ethnic groups and religious sects that love to hate each other. Though few want foreign troops to stick around, most were happy to see Saddam brought down. Iran has nearly 3 times the population of Iraq, and are overwhelmingly of one religious sect, and by most reports, a lot more cohesive than Iraq. Occupying Iran would entail numbers of US troops that would dwarf the Iraq numbers. As a preemptive war, it just wouldn't fly politically.\r\n\r\n3) Whatever one may think the Bush administration's intent is, they are working for a stable Iraq. Few viable conspiracy theories suggest otherwise. Going into Iran would likely send the *relatively* stable Shiite south of Iraq into a frenzy, and would empower those attempting to destabilize in other regions too. This is also why they will be hesistant to bomb specific sites, or to let Israel do so.\r\n\r\nThere are many other reasons, but those are the big boys that come to mind.

The US insisted (begged) Israel not to retaliate when Saddam dropped scuds on them. Saddam hoped to pull them into the war, for that would have made it nearly impossible for the Arab governments in the region to maintain their support. The hatred of Israel is one of the greatest unifying factors in the region. In the current Iraq war, you will find no Israelis around. They would be very helpful, but there was a very conscious decision to keep them out of it. Do your homework.\r\n\r\nAlso, with respect to a few of the European governemnts that initially contributed troops to the current Iraq war: Spanish government: tossed from office. Italian government: about to be tossed from office. British government: Took major losses in the recent election. Europeans electorate as a whole: More opposed than ever.\r\n\r\n&gt; what they want is access to oil, a puppet regime to them is just bonus points\r\n\r\nIf this is true (I believe it is much more complicated than *just* oil) then they need stability to get oil out.

Certainly conventional thinking can get you through a conventional day, but, being conditioned, it would be difficult to toss it aside to solve a non-conventional problem.\r\n\r\nSo, to the point, using mapper/packer just to label things or people seems like a packer activity.

It will hurt the dollar if main producers of oil begin selling their goods in other currencies. \r\n\r\nHowever, alienating the US is not a good idea for the oil producing nations, particularly since the U.S. is the staunchest oil hog out there, and has long maintained unholy alliances with countries such as Saudi Arabia as long as they play along.

Whether it is my mom being a librarian because she simply loves books, and figures that there is indeed some tough times that will have to be had before the goal is met, or friends who just don't understand how to translate what they love (what they would do  as work without being paid) into a living.\r\n\r\nFor me, the concept of making money is easy. I am a born entreprenuer, but with all the businesses and ventures I have started, they have always been about money. So yes, I know how to make money. And I do indeed know now after reading this article that you MUST love what you do to get past this 70% barrier I have sufferred from most of my life, except for this brief period when I was in grade 9, living with my father, when I excelled into the 90%+ range, as far as school was concerned. Reflecting now, it was simply because I enjoyed it. And the classes I didn't enjoy at that time, I was in the 70% range. I did it well, because the way you do anything is the way you do everything, but the fact is I did much better by default when I enjoyed what I was doing.\r\n\r\nSo, find what you love. If you love to read, and love literature, figure out why. Maybe you could write reviews for a living? Startup a website and publish them! If it's cars you love, then look at them and see why you enjoy them.  If its the mechanics, become someone that designs cars for a living. Point is, find what you enjoy to do, right now.

Our system is a Republic, a representative democracy, not a pure democracy.  If they wanted a pure democracy they would not have limited who could vote, and restricted what they could vote for.  Our founding fathers were familiar with history and knew about the failures of Athens and Rome, and tried to build a system that would be safer from the corrupting forces of power and the mob.\r\n\r\nIn your post above you yourself appear to hold two contradictory positions - that the mob should rule, and that the (the Constitution) law should.  Those two never jibe.  There have been plenty of cases where the majority of Americans are poorly educated enough that they want unconstitutional things enacted.  Fortuntely our founding fathers were much more subtle then you in their analysis of how to make a government and run it, so they rejected mob rule, and embraced the rule of law.\r\n\r\nThe internments were not just morally wrong, they were actally unconstitutional, which is why we paid (inadequate) reparations.  Side note - I have (distant) family that lost several hundred acres of farmland in southern California, which the government then resold while they were interned.  That land is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  My family members and their close kin got nothing.  They were American citizens, they paid their taxes, and were as supportive of the war as anyone else, but they were put in a camp, and had everything stolen from them because of the color of theis skin.  We should all do what we can to prevent that kind of anti-American activity from occuring again."}

Can you say anything about a U.S. response or a U.S. reaction to this uproar in Europe over the Prophet Muhammad pictures? Do you have any reaction to it? Are you concerned that the violence is going to spread and make everything just --\r\n\r\nMR. MCCORMACK: I haven't seen any -- first of all, this is matter of fact. I haven't seen it. I have seen a lot of protests. I've seen a great deal of distress expressed by Muslims across the globe. The Muslims around the world have expressed the fact that they are outraged and that they take great offense at the images that were printed in the Danish newspaper, as well as in other newspapers around the world.\r\n\r\nOur response is to say that while we certainly don't agree with, support, or in some cases, we condemn the views that are aired in public that are published in media organizations around the world, we, at the same time, defend the right of those individuals to express their views. For us, freedom of expression is at the core of our democracy and it is something that we have shed blood and treasure around the world to defend and we will continue to do so. That said, there are other aspects to democracy, our democracy -- democracies around the world -- and that is to promote understanding, to promote respect for minority rights, to try to appreciate the differences that may exist among us.\r\n\r\nWe believe, for example in our country, that people from different religious backgrounds, ethnic backgrounds, national backgrounds add to our strength as a country. And it is important to recognize and appreciate those differences. And it is also important to protect the rights of individuals and the media to express a point of view concerning various subjects. So while we share the offense that Muslims have taken at these images, we at the same time vigorously defend the right of individuals to express points of view. We may -- like I said, we may not agree with those points of view, we may condemn those points of view but we respect and emphasize the importance that those individuals have the right to express those points of view.\r\n\r\nFor example -- and on the particular cartoon that was published -- I know the Prime Minister of Denmark has talked about his, I know that the newspaper that originally printed it has apologized, so they have addressed this particular issue. So we would urge all parties to exercise the maximum degree of understanding, the maximum degree of tolerance when they talk about this issue. And we would urge dialogue, not violence. And that also those that might take offense at these images that have been published, when they see similar views or images that could be perceived as anti-Semitic or anti-Catholic, that they speak out with equal vigor against those images.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: That the Muslims speak out with equal vigor when they see -- that's what you're asking?\r\n\r\nMR. MCCORMACK: We would -- we believe that it is an important principle that peoples around the world encourage dialogue, not violence; dialogue, not misunderstanding and that when you see an image that is offensive to another particular group, to speak out against that. Anti-Muslim images are as unacceptable as anti-Semitic images, as anti-Christian images or any other religious belief. We have to remember and respect the deeply held beliefs of those who have different beliefs from us. But it is important that we also support the rights of individuals to express their freely held views.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: So basically you're just hoping that it doesn't -- I'm sorry I misspoke when I said there was violence, I meant uproar. Your bottom line is that both sides have the right to do exactly as they're doing and you just hope it doesn't get worse?\r\n\r\nMR. MCCORMACK: Well, I --\r\n\r\nQUESTION: You just hope it doesn't escalate.\r\n\r\nMR. MCCORMACK: I gave a pretty long answer, so --\r\n\r\nQUESTION: You did. I'm trying to sum it up for you. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMR. MCCORMACK: Yeah. Sure.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: A couple of years ago, I think it was a couple of years ago when, I think it was the Syrians and the Lebanese were introducing this documentary about the Jews -- or it was the Egyptians -- this Administration spoke out very strongly about that and called it offensive, said it was --\r\n\r\nMR. MCCORMACK: I just said that the images were offensive; we found them offensive.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Well, no you said that you understand that the Muslims found them offensive, but --\r\n\r\nMR. MCCORMACK: I'm saying now, we find them offensive. And we certainly understand why Muslims would find these images offensive.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: One word is puzzling me in this, Sean, and that's the use of the word \"unacceptable\" and \"not acceptable,\" exactly what that implies. I mean, it's not quite obvious that you find the images offensive. When you say \"unacceptable,\" it applies some sort of action against the people who perpetrate those images.\r\n\r\nMR. MCCORMACK: No. I think I made it very clear that our defense of freedom of expression and the ability of individuals and media organizations to engage in free expression is forthright and it is strong, you know. This is -- our First Amendment rights, the freedom of expression, are some of the most strongly held and dearly held views that we have here in America. And certainly nothing that I said, I would hope, would imply any diminution of that support.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: It's just the one word \"unacceptable,\" I'm just wondering if that implied any action, you know. But it doesn't you say?\r\n\r\nMR. MCCORMACK: No.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Okay.\r\n\r\nMR. MCCORMACK: Yes.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Do you caution America media against publishing those cartoons?\r\n\r\nMR. MCCORMACK: That's for you and your editors to decide, and that's not for the government. We don't own the printing presses.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Sean, these cartoons first surfaced in late September and it's following this recent election with the Palestinian Authority. The EU mission was attacked or held, in effect, by Hamas yesterday near Gaza City. And the tact of some of these European newspapers, again, are to re-publish -- these cartoons. Is the election mood -- is this what is possibly fueling this and what is our media response to this, a la, what Katherine Hughes may or may not do versus international State Department and government media to the Muslim world, including Indonesia, Asia, and the Middle East?\r\n\r\nMR. MCCORMACK: I don't think your colleagues really want me to repeat the long answer that I gave to Teri, so I'd refer you to that answer.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_18gy","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1139013661}

There are a lot of fundamentalist Muslims for various reasons, but in part because it is the policies of the United States since the 1950's, as we promoted Islamic fundamentalism as an ideological tool to use against both progressive nationalism and communism.  We originally promoted a very extremist reactionary form of Islam in Saudi Arabia to help foil communism and nationalism.  We trained the Taliban in Afghanistan to serve as a foil to the Soviets.  We even trained Osama Bin Laden himself and supplied him with money.  After the Cold War ended, the ideologies we were providing a foil against essentially disappeared, and fundamentalism filled the vacuum, much to our dismay.  I am not saying other factors were not involved, I am just saying that we helped to create the sorceror's apprentice that has now gone out of control.\r\n\r\nFundamentalist Christians do not use violence as much an Muslims right now, thanks in no small part to the efffectiveness of our Western societies in maintaiing a respect for the rule of law, and a tend of promoting liberal democracy that finds violence abhorrent.  All the same, Christians in the US have in the name of religion blown up abortion clinics, murdered abortion providers, murdered gays, and threatened violence againt those whom they disagree with.  The extremists in the Christina Identity movement in the US have killed police officers, committed bombings, plotted a number of terrorist attacks (fortunately virtually all were foiled by the FBI), and committed many hate crimes.  They just don't get a lot of news coverage by the 'liberal' media. In the US politicians are courting them and promoting policies that help them grow, and thanks to Bush we are funding their programs.  \r\n\r\nGoing into speculation land, I expect that there will be a breaking point at some point when there is a lot of tension in our society, for instance when fosil fuel becomes scarce or when environmental changes become more sever, where fundamentalists in the US that will take even more control, and their violence will grow.","score":31,"ups":31,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1139071864,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_193z","id":"c197t","author_flair_text":null,"author":"moof1138","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473820926,"gilded":0}

I compare his insight to that of Maxwell Maltz who developed Psycho- Cybernetics.  If you've read P-C, that is saying a LOT.\r\n\r\nHTDWYL could, maybe, be further developed into a practical approach about HOW goalless people (like me) could discover worthwhile goals.  \r\n\r\nIn P-C Maltz never talked about HOW to engage in goal-setting, per se.....  He just assumed that you HAD a goal or goals, and he more or less proved that they're necessary for fulfillment.  Its impossible to deny his logic and wisdom.  But many people simply DON'T have them, for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nLack of goals doesn't mean you're lazy, incompetent, or anything like that.  It just means that you have interests that are sufficiently varied to preclude intense focus on any particular one.  And maybe \"focused\" people are just autistic in a different way.\r\n\r\nDo we HAVE to have goals?  No.  We exist without them, obviously, but having one or two important goals must be a very good feeling.

You have to have a significant amount of money already to do it, so it is beyond the reach of many people.\r\n\r\nThe social model here is also (IMO) suboptimal in that there aren't many benefits for the unemployed or poor, but instead, it's hard to fire people, so that the burden is shifted to corporations, who are forced to pay for people they don't need, rather than, say, being taxed as in the nordic countries, so that the government fills that role.  Or, as the society sees fit, simply let people take care of themselves as in the US.

Christ was not condoning violence nor telling anyone to use it. He was simply saying that what he taught would be extremely provocative and would turn others (for example communities and families) against each other. And he was correct.\r\n\r\n&gt; In the epistles in the N.T., they describe killing an early Christian for charging interest on a loan.\r\n\r\nYou took this out of context, too.\r\n\r\nYou are speaking of the classic example of Ananias and Sapphira.\r\n\r\n*1Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property. 2With his wife's full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles' feet.*\r\n \r\n*3Then Peter said, \"Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? 4Didn't it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God.\"* \r\n\r\n*5When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. 6Then the young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him.*\r\n\r\nIt has absolutely nothing to do with \"charging interest on a loan\" as you claim, and nothing to do with any human killing someone else. You *really* twisted the story there.\r\n\r\n&gt; The Old Testament contains many bloodbaths perpetrated by the protagonists, with Yaweh egging on the slaughter, and rebuking those who show mercy or compassion, since his described goal is for the Israelites to conquer various lands he decreed to them and slaughter any who stand in the way.\r\n\r\nYou'll find those bloodbaths never occured to an innocent nation that did nothing. They occured when other nations attacked Israel first, particularly when they (the Israelites) were in a state of vulnerability.\r\n\r\n&gt; Both books are awash with contradictions and inconsistencies, which is a real problem.\r\n\r\nI've still yet to find someone who can find honest contradictions. Most of the time it has to do with the person taking the passages out of context (like you did in your above statements).\r\n\r\n&gt; Fundamentalists despite claiming that their book is dictated by God, and is absolute truth, never read their religious books seriously or critically. They always pick and choose passages that justify their views. Whatever their religion, fundamentalists foment in their followers fear, alienation, and anger, and in their more extreme forms teach that extremism and violence in the name of religion are right.\r\n\r\nThat was quite the generalization.\r\n\r\nListen, I have no problem with you being critical of any religion, just be honest when doing so.

It went through many changes. Here's a link to a [university site timeline](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/a/canon.html). The 325  C.E. Council of Nicea was more about Constantine having the new Bishops solidify something for him to work with as he established the empire under a new religion (at mom's urging if I remember correctly.) I believe the historical importance of it with regard to orthodoxy was that it spelled out the Man/God combo of Jesus in the **Nicean Creed.** They still recite that badboy at Catholic services (among others), as it is permanently ingrained in my head after 20 years of indoctrination.\r\n\r\nThat timeline, and the texts I was checking out only include what we know about. The theological councils of *The One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church* were likely more secretive then than they are now. It looks like the big codification took place in response to that rebel, Martin Luther, who, I will admit, had balls the size of coconuts.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the \"colorful miracle working-prophets\", colorful was an adjective to modify *miracle-working*.

After I got back from movies and shopping today, reddit somehow forgot my password and wouldn't let me log in, so I created a new account.\r\n\r\nThe N.T. and O.T. do have passages that can be used to justify violence, but as I said most of those that use them to justify violence are not reading the passages critically or seriously - they are finding what they are looking for.  I agree that in general Jesus' message was one of peace.  But the various writers of the books of the N.T. slipped in a few passages that are pro-violence, and the Bible itself is both contradictory and gives plenty of material for those who want to use it to justify violence:\r\n\r\nLuke 22:35-38: 'And He said to them, \"When I sent you out without money belt and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?\" They said, \"No, nothing.\" And He said to them, \"But now, whoever has a money belt is to take it along, likewise also a bag, and whoever has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one. For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me, 'And he was numbered with transgressors'; for that which refers to Me has its fulfillment.\" They said, \"Lord, look, here are two swords.\" And He said to them, \"It is enough.\"' - If Jesus is telling his followers to buy weapons, I expect Jesus means for them to use them.\r\n\r\nJohn 2:13-16 'When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the Temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves and others sitting at tables exchanging money. So he made a whip out of cords and drove all from the Temple, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. To those who sold doves he said: \"Get out of here.\"'  Jesus was hitting people with a whip.\r\n\r\nLuke 19:26-27 'I say to you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.  As for my enemies who do not want me to reign over them, bring them here and kill them in my presence'\r\n\r\nMatthew 10:34-35 \"Do not think that I have come to send peace on Earth.  I did not come to send peace, but a sword.  I am sent to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law\" - Your previous interpretation is extra-textual.\r\n\r\nGen 4:15 (et al) God is a vengeful God.\r\nExodus 15:3 (et al) God is a fierce warrior.\r\nLeviticus 26:7-8 (et al) The spirit of God kills people.\r\nEzra 6:12 God is jealous and furious.\r\nGal 5:22-23 The fruit of the Spirit of God is peace , love, joy, patience, kindness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.  \r\n\r\nGen 11:7-9 God himself sows discord.\r\nProverbs 6:16-19 God hates those who sows discord.\r\n\r\nExodus 20:5 - Children should and do suffer for their parent's sins\r\nDeuternonmy 24:16 - Children are not to suffer for their parent's sins.\r\n\r\nGen 1:3-5 On the first day, God created light, then separated light and darkness.\r\nGen 1:14-19 The sun (which separates night and day) wasn't created until the fourth day.\r\nGen 1:11-12, 26-27 Trees were created before man was created.\r\nGen 2:4-9 Man was created before trees were created.\r\n\r\nGen 1:20-21, 26-27 Birds were created before man was created.\r\nGen 2:7, 19 Man was created before birds were created.\r\n\r\nGen 1:24-27 Animals were created before man was created.\r\nGen 2:7, 19 Man was created before animals were created.\r\n\r\nGen 1:26-27 Man and woman were created at the same time.\r\nGen 2:7, 21-22 Man was created first, woman sometime later.\r\n\r\nGen 10:5 There were many languages before the Tower of Babel\r\nGen 11:1 There was one language before the Tower of Babel\r\n\r\n2 Kings 8:26 Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign.\r\n2 Chronicles 22:2 Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign.\r\n\r\n2 Samuel 6:23 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death \r\n2 Samuel 21:8 But the king took...the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul.\r\n\r\nIn the N.T. there are two accounts of Jesus' genealogy which are contradictory.:\r\nMatthew 1:1-17 \r\nLuke 3:23-38\r\n\r\nThere are two inconsistent accounts of his death:\r\n\r\nLuke23:46: And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.\" \r\nJohn 19:30  When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.\r\n\r\nI could go on for many pages with more examples of contradictions and justifications for violence in the Bible.  The book is  a serious mess, and really could have used a few talented editors to clean it up. \r\n\r\nWe also have many outright errors in the bible: \r\nI Kings 7:23-26 -  Pi is equal to three.\r\nLev 11:20-21 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you. -Except that birds don't crawl on all fours.\r\nLev 11:6 \"And the hare, because he cheweth the cud...\"\r\nmore hare chewing cud:\r\nDeut 14:7 \"...as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof.\"\r\nMatt 13:31-32: \"the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which\u2026is the least of all seeds, but when it is grown is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree.\" - there are plenty of seeds smaller than a mustard seed.  Also mustard plants don't grow into trees.\r\n\r\nYou are correct that I misrecalled the details of the Ananias and Sapphira as I was rushing through, and while I have read the N.T. (and have read Mark and John in Greek), it was a while back, so I conflated keeping a few buck for themselves with usury.  I really am afraid that I am not really interested in the Bible these days, so my memory of details is fading.\r\n\r\nAs for generalizing about fundamentalists, would you say that the Christian fundamentalists *are* really understanding the true nature of their religion when they murder doctors, police, bomb buildings?  When you read their writings, and see their hate crimes, do you not find fear, alienation, and anger?  If not, what would you say drives people to murder their fellow men in the name of religion?\r\n\r\nYour notion that all the tribes that were slaughtered in the O.T. were somehow asking for it, and that the slaughter even their children and animals is utterly abhorrent.  Saying that the murder of children is acceptable due to their parent's transgressions is beyond the pale."}

The idea is that, once upon a time, the easiest way to make everyone in a given society behave themselves was to make all social decisions economic -- bad behavior was punished gruesome public torture, i.e. the negative utility for breaking the rules was astronomically high even if it wasn't likely you'd get caught.  The key point for this discussion is that the punishments were more intended for deterrent effect than they were to exact retribution.\r\n\r\nEventually, societies became too disparate and too specialized for repressive social structures to work any more so the ideological society evolved, wherein we internalize a society's values and feel *guilt*.  We punish ourselves for thinking about crime, and so only rarely manage to actually commit any.\r\n\r\nIdeological societies are a recent development -- say maybe starting in Britain in the mid 1800s.  The Israelites and early Christians were both definitely repressive, which means that they *viewed violence in a fundamentally different way than we do*.  That is, setting unbelievers on fire or cutting off people's hands for stealing were just the way an effective society was administered.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a political scientist would note that even in these enlightened times, every traffic ticket and IRS reporting regulation is ultimately collected or enforced by the threat of violence.  In fact, we can even define \"The State\" as \"holder of the monopoly on the legitimate first use of force in a given geographic area.\"  But we don't really consider parking citations violent -- they're just something we have to keep our society in working order.","score":-1,"ups":-1,"created_utc":1139118941,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com"}

So if a node on a data transfer route leaves the network, MUTE automatically redirects data to the next shortest route. Also the MUTE network is zero trust. There is no weakness, like you have to trust your neigbour nodes or anything. In my opnion the MUTE network is the most promising anonymous network.

It all comes down to how powerful the adversary is in terms of network resources, and the compromises made between speed (bandwith usage) and anonymity. No rerouting network will ever be 100% free of attacks. If the adversary owns all other nodes in the network, it is very difficult (impossible) to stay anonymous.

However that is not important in a p2p network.\r\n\r\nThe scalability of MUTE is actually surprisingly good, due to the adaptive nature of ACO, where data constantly migrates towards the fastest ( shortest ) routes. This means that if a node that is part of a route, is being swamped with data, other routes might be faster. And MUTE uses a stochaistic model to keep less frequently travelled routes alive. One of these routes may turn out to be faster and will slowly gain more traffic.

He's just arguing that religion has no /overall/ survival value for human beings.\r\n\r\nTo start off with, what do you mean by \"overall\"? If someone doesn't commit suicide because they have found hope in religion, that has directly had value to their survival. Or maybe someone is able to continue on with a very important project of theirs because of their strong faith, and that in turn leads to the survival of thousands?

Much like yoga, or chess, or reading, it provides select individuals with a sense of well-being that they feel helps them in their lives.

Like many group activities, it does incredible damage to the world, both in terms of waste of resources and in terms of specific nastiness like religious war.  Every religion, without exception, has examples of a bunch of followers getting together and going killing in the name of their religion.  Some religions have a relatively small number of such examples, some, like Christianity and Islam, have a hell of a lot.  No honest religious person can deny any of this, although many religious persons will say that the people who did the nasty things were not \"truly X\", where X is their preferred religion.\r\n\r\nI think the point of disagreement between you and Dawkins is that you have different opinions of the relative magnitude of you feeling good because you have religion and millions dying in religious conflict.","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1139159224,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"c19wj","parent_id":"t1_c19ud","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mattknox","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473820939,"gilded":0}

The central question for Dawkins is: \"If a person is born with psychological tendencies which make them credulous enough to become relgious, will this increase their overall chance of survival\". Dawkins answers YES to this question. However, there is a second question: \"Does religious belief, in itself, increase the chance of a person's survival\". The answer Dawkins gives to this question is NO. It doesn't matter that /some/ people have benefited from their beliefs. The question is whether more than 50% of religious people benefit from their beliefs.\r\n\r\nSo where are his stats to back this up if it comes down to a percentage number?\r\n\r\n&gt; Fairly obviously, you have to consider whether the advantages of being religious outway the disadvantages (on average).

It's always misguided followers of some other religion.\r\n\r\nYou say you are a Christian.  Eric Rudolph says he is a Christian.  You note that it says in a book( which you say contains the word of God) that killing people, which was at one point mostly ok, became a really bad thing sometime between 1AD and the widespread standardization of the bible.\r\nYou further note that Rudolph killed people, and that therefore you don't think he should be considered a Christian.  Rudolph begs to differ.  What to do?\r\n\r\nThere are a few choices available here: I can decide that yes indeed, you are correct, and a close textual analysis of  your book reveals that this guy is not in very good concert with the main character of the latter part of your book.  I should therefore call you a \"christian\", and this other guy a \"dangerous kook\".  This has the side effect of making part of our language directly dependent on a 3+ generation translation of a transcription of a bunch of oral history, but no matter.  The problem here is that now I, who have no interest in religion, have to referee for you religious types on who is what.  This is not so good.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I can say that both you and he fit nicely within the current popular definition of christian, and that English is defined not by etymology but by current standard usage.  I can then leave it to the people who identify as christians to either get togther on what it means, or to invent terms for themselves to differentiate, or to police themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is an intriguing logical fallacy at work here:  you have a set of values, and people who deviate from those values enough are said not to be following your religion.  Therefore, by definition, no one following your religion has ever murdered!  While it is regrettably true that some have temporarily strayed, gone on a murderous rampage, and then returned to grace, no practicing christian has ever killed a soul!\r\n\r\nI think a more honest way to define \"following christianity\" is to call it about the standard way: if someone goes to church, says they are a christian, and such, then call them a christian.  If they then do nasty things, admit that a christian did nasty things.  Finally, if they do nasty things in the name of their religion, admit that they did nasty things in the name of their religion, and consider that as a negative to be weighed against the comfort you feel in dark times.\r\n\r\nIf a bunch of agnostics started going around and burning churches, mosques, and synagogues because they didn't want people worshipping, I would want to stop them, even though there is no real agnostic group or identity.  It is interesting that the religious, desipite their far greater cohesion, do not seem to feel the same way.","retrieved_on":1473820940,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_c19xd","id":"c19z6","author_flair_text":null,"author":"mattknox"}

You might as well say that froobles are not snortly, and it would make just as much sense.

I believe, but cannot prove, that the mostly non-rational way our brains work (another conjecture, but I am not making it lightly) keep many highly educated people from reaching that same conclusion.\r\n\r\n&gt; there's a greater step involved in leaping from \"evidence of absence\" to \"absolute proof of absence\".\r\n\r\nCertainly, but remember, it is the vagueness of the 'god' concept that precludes evidence of absence. And I think belief in god can be adequately explained from the point of view of evolutionary biology, low-level brain functions and historical and cultural developments. Belief in god persists not because the concept of god is so powerful, but because it fits nicely with the way our minds work. \r\n\r\n&gt; in defending hard atheism, [...] you are letting your personal prejudices trample the available evidence.\r\n\r\nNo, I assure you I am not.

In April 2003, the company filed a petition with the Consumer Product Safety Commission to make SawStop-like technology standard on all table saws. Six months later, the Power Tool Institute, a consortium of 17 power-tool makers, filed an opposing brief in which it argued that SawStop is a \"speculative and untested technology. In addition, the cost to consumers and manufacturers of granting the petition would far outweigh any benefits that may be realized.\" The industry also claims to be developing its own safety systems. The CPSC is expected to release its findings this summer. If it states, as Gass hopes and expects, that the technology is effective, it will be the first step in a long process of making SawStop -- or a similar injury-prevention system -- mandatory.\"\r\n\r\nAs cool as the technology is, it is totally WRONG to use gov't to force other manufacturers to adopt it (or something like it, which they could then probably sue over).

There is also no way to disprove the existence of god. If you don't believe me [...]\r\n\r\nOh, I do believe this, absolutely, in the modern sense of the word 'god', where all that is left of god is a concept that by definition can not be reasoned about. Of course, in any sense that 'god' did impinge on the world, he has been disproven, and thus the concept has devolved into a meaningles statement.\r\n\r\n&gt; If you don't believe me, google up \"Alvin Plantinga\" -- he's a philosophy prof at Notre Dame -- and read a few of his papers.\r\n\r\nHe's a Christian apologetic, right (says Wikipedia)? I am going to need a better referral than that, really.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologetics#Intellectual_and_social_function_of_religious_apologetics  :\r\n&gt; Apologetics serves an intellectual function within religious communities by providing arguments that support the doctrinal and ethical tenets of the religion. These arguments strengthen the believer's faith and support the propagation of the religion by offering arguments intended to persuade the uncommitted.\r\n\r\n&gt; Skeptics engaged in debate with apologists tend to expect apologetics to consist of powerful arguments intended to persuade skeptics, and are sometimes surprised by the failure of these arguments to even approach this goal. Occasionally, it's because the apologist just isn't any good. Most often, though, it's because the arguments only had the purpose of giving current believers license to continue believing. Since skeptics are not the intended target at all, these arguments aim for a much lower burden, not trying to do more than make the religious belief plausible or cast doubt on skeptical arguments.\r\n\r\nmnemonicsloth:\r\n&gt; Shifting the burden of proof to the believer is thus a way to make believers lose the argument -- which isn't what this kind of discussion is supposed to be about.\r\n\r\nThat is just silly. Placing the burden of proof on the the party making the claim is simple common sense. One can make an infinite amount of claims about reality - any such claim is essentially worthless unless backed up by facts. Or you will need to consider [sofas circling Saturn](http://reddit.com/info?id=19z7#c1ae3). Of course, we have already agreed that the existence of god is placed outside of rational argument by the all too convenient definition of 'god', so the question is moot.\r\n\r\n&gt; In particular, your proposition that 'it should be obvious that this is not a rational position to take' is not an argument. It's a statement of your opinion.\r\n\r\nYou are actually arguing that something is true unless disproven? (To quote myself: *The believer asserts that something is true unless disproven. It should be obvious that this is not a rational position to take.*) That is quite an amazing position to take. Have you thought this through? \r\n\r\n&gt; That makes you no better than all the other crazed believers.\r\n\r\nI take objection to that. Perhaps you have just misread what I said, though.

A plain fact of life is that most water is flushed, goes down the drain in the shower, is used in washing machines &amp; dish washers, and whatever else - and its simply too expensive to get the water whistle clean - like 7ppm solid particulates.\r\n\r\n* municipalities should be constantly monitoring their water for contaminants, but (1) many \"upper safe limits\" set by the FDA/EPA (EPA in this case) are controversial, and there isn't total agreement on what should be monitored in the first place. Some may monitor MTBE and perchlorate, while others do not. Note that there are literally thousands of chemicals in water - some natural , some man-made, and testing for all of them is tough. Water from the colorado river seems to have high levels of perchlorate.\r\n\r\n* Municipal water quality *may* change by season. In Phoenix, when the monsoons come, supposedly the solid particulates are elevated.\r\n\r\n* your best bet for clean safe water is to either find a filter for your home which is reverse osmosis and steam distilled - but beware, because there are lots of peddlers in this domain -- or find a water store *that you can trust* - see below. If using a home-water filter, use a potassium rather than sodium ion exchanger.\r\n\r\n* if you decide to go the water-store route, realize that they don't all use the same equipment, some may be more deligent than others about when to replace their filter, and some may be able to give you independent report which shows their filter effectiveness. See below on water storage. The person working at the store, or the owner, should at least be able to tell you what the typical amount of solid particlates in ppm is - it should be between 5 and 15.\r\n\r\n* locate a lab in your area that can analyze the water for particulate matter and other disolved compounds. if your tap water / water store / home filtered water lives up to your expectations, great.\r\n\r\n* For storing water: glass works best, but there are some obvious disadvantages. It is the most stable, and there will be no chance of solvents \"leaching\" into your water. For portability, re-use a bottle, like a Nalgene bottle to minimize environmental waste. Whatever brand you decide on, your best bet looks like polycarbonate despite the fears of bisphenol. Polycarb is a hard clear plastic - get something without dyes. Avoid the plastic bottles that look \"cloudy\", often used for 1 and 1.5 gallon bottled water. Avoid plastic bottled made out of PET (pet polyethylene tetraphthalate). If you use a plastic bottle, don't expose it to much UV (sunlight), as it is unknown whether the bottle you hold in your hand has UV stabilizers. To be extra safe, avoid exposing your polycarb bottles to exreme heat - like the dishwasher - even though a study showed that this is generally not a problem. Other plastics may fare more poorly. Some popular glass bottle sizes might be able to fit into a insulation sleve often fitted for Nalgene bottles - you can get these at an REI or other outdoor sports store.\r\n\r\n* Distilled water is OK for you, but make sure you get total, in your diet, the right amount of Magnesium and Calcium. Studies have shown that there is a corelation between cardiovascular disease and localities which have water low in minerals - but you can make up for this yourself by taking a good Calcium (calcium citrate) or Magnesium (magnesium citrate) supplement, which are often cheap. Try Solgar, Now, Solaray, or Nature's Way. Recommended ratio Ca:mg used to be 2:1 , but now is like 1:0.7.\r\n\r\n* folks with kidney problems may have to pay even more attention to water quality,\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_1aj7","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1139258596}

Movie stars, directors, and special-effects houses that demand millions or tens of millions of dollars per production, a push towards overly polished and refined end products, and the countless mid-level parasites that take their cut at every stage of the process have combined to turn Hollywood into something far exceeding the parodies that it has always inspired.

I went straight from college to grad school, against others' advice, because at the time that I applied I felt I was ready. By the time I started to realize I might have been wrong about that, I'd already been accepted at UCLA and thought it would be foolish to decline. So I didn't take any time off, and am now burned out and unmotivated. I'm also afraid to quit, since I don't actually know why I don't like  grad school, or what I'd rather be doing instead.\r\n\r\nHere's a funny thing: in accordance with what Paul said, I do actually produce on a regular basis. I write/blog, I work on my webpage, I cook, I bake, I draw, and I foster meaningful relationships with other people. The problem is that I don't see what I produce leading to any sort of career. I don't blog about anything that would fascinate a general audience. I don't want to make webpages for anyone but myself. I have tendinitis in my wrists, so I can't pursue cooking (or, probably, drawing) as a profession. And I'm so incorrigibly sincere that I can't make a living out of any of the (well-paying) jobs that require fostering relationships with lots of people. So while I know what I love, in that sense, I don't know how to translate \"what I love\" into a job that I love.\r\n\r\nStill, I'm quite young, so I have plenty of time to figure things out, but of course in the meantime I'm left wondering what to do. Should I stay with the safe path I'm already on, or blaze a new trail for myself? Sigh.

At a distance you admire the abstract forms, but it is only when you come closer and study it in detail that you see what it is composed of.\n\n(He used this trick before in his 1992 work \"[Mosaic](http://images.google.com/images?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2005-09,GGGL:en&amp;amp;q=delvoye%20mosaic&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wi)\". The work consists of glazed tiles bearing an identical image, arranged to form symmetrical and highly ornate patterns. It is only on closer inspection that you realize that on each tile, you see 2 turds -the artist's own excrement!)\n\nThe scatological interests of Wim Delvoye are even more clear in his latest instalment: [Cloaca](http://www.cloaca.be), a machine that was \"fed\" an exquisite meal twice a day, and -mimicking the working of the intestines- produced a fresh pile of shit every day.

{"body":"LEDs are *expensive*, and here's why:\r\n\r\n1. You make 'em on wafers, which means you've got to go through a couple of cycles of {bake, photoresist, develop, dope, anneal, etch}.  Each one of those requires big infrastructure (furnaces, ion implanters), nasty chemicals (chemical-weapons-grade nasty in sometimes), and it all has to be done in a cleanroom.  This is going to be like making solar panels, but more expensive because silicon semiconductors don't emit light, and light-emitting semiconductor materials (gallium, indium) are much more difficult to work with.\r\n\r\n2. When you're done, you wind up with a few wafers on the order of four square feet.  Even if you get a 10:1 area improvement from packaging and mounting the dice (that's plural for \"die\", i.e. chip), you still put in a lot more effort than you would to produce an equivalent number of incandescent lightbulbs -- even if your LEDs last 10 times as long.\r\n\r\n3. LEDs like DC at low voltage, optimally about 0.7 volts.  Existing electrical apparatus is 180V AC.  I can elaborate on this topic for a looong time if anyone is curious :-)  Suffice it to say that you have to either accept a shorter lifetime for your diodes by having them turn on &amp; off all the time (wasting power too) or you have to convert your power into low-voltage/high-current, which dissipates a lot of heat.  The other option is to have a little DC voltage regulator for each diode -- which means more silicon, see #1 above.\r\n\r\n4. The light is nasty -- all monochrome.  We only get a few colors to mix together, and it's harder than with fluorescent lights because you're \"mixing\" discrete solid-state devices instead of different gases in a tube.  [this link](http://ledmuseum.home.att.net/ledrgb.htm) is kind of interesting if you're interested.\r\n\r\nSo unfortunately, LEDs are prbably never going to be uesful as light sources except for things like emergency flashlights -- small amounts of light to keep your rod-vision working, rather than large amounts of light to saturate your environment and keep you in a good mood.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_1b8q","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1139318140,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mnemonicsloth","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_c1bj8","id":"c1bki","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473820971}

For the record -- since network-delivered text often fails to activate our empathic-social-interaction ganglia -- when I'm verbalizing these posts to myself as I write them, I use a civil tone :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I've got to take issue with one of your quotes, on the grounds that it contains assumptions that privilege an atheistic viewpoint:\r\n\r\n&gt; &gt; Skeptics engaged in debate with apologists tend to expect apologetics to consist of powerful arguments intended to persuade skeptics, and are sometimes surprised by the failure of these arguments to even approach this goal. Occasionally, it's because the **apologist just isn't any good**. Most often, though, it's because the arguments only had the purpose of giving **current believers license to continue believing.** Since skeptics are not the intended target at all, these arguments **aim for a much lower burden,** not trying to do more than make the religious belief plausible or cast doubt on skeptical arguments.  (emphasis is mine)\r\n\r\nI read that as: \"Some apologetics aren't very good, and others are less interested in truth than in propping up their preconceptions.\"  This isn't debate, it's genteel mud-slinging, and since it purports to explian the \"Intellectual and Social Function\" of a whole *class* of people, you could even call it bigoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; ...in the modern sense of the word 'god', where all that is left of god is a concept that by definition can not be reasoned about\r\n\r\nHow do you separate things are subject to reason ('reasonable') from things that are not ('unreasonable')?  Certainly the status of being neither demonstably true nor demonstrably false is insufficient to declare that an idea unreasonable.  In mathematics, the Axiom of Choice ('C') falls into this category -- some theorists assert C, others assert not-C, and both are reasonable.  The existence of real numbers (i.e. limits, calculus) is predicated on the former choice, and much important work in computability theory rests on the latter.\r\n\r\nSo I think you have to do some more work than just claiming that 'god' is a malformed idea.  Some people seem able to assume the existence of actors or agentive observers involved in the origin of the universe, and reason effectively (if not always correctly) from there.  Other people assert that there are no such entities, and reason effectively (if not always correctly) from there.  Both systems of thinking occasionally produce interesting results, and both systems could turn out to be wrong (if, for example, the universe has no beginning or end in time).

{"controversiality":0,"body":"First, let me agree that there is not a shortage of people with science degrees.  Then let me immediately emphasize that there is a shortage of skilled engineers and scientists.  I see two reasons for this, and despite my love for the free market, government intervention could in theory actually help (it probably won't, but that's because of the incompetence of our government, not because it's a bad idea). \r\n\r\nFirst, some capable Americans do not have the opportunity to study science.  Like a nerd born in Poetistan, some potential engineers are born in school districts that inhibit, rather than promote, math and science education.  Generally, the fact that a school district has a problem is a sign that no market force will correct the problem--the parents and teachers in the district teach it in a painful way because to them it is painful.\r\n\r\nSecond, capable Americans with the opportunity to study science or engineering are almost always better off going into business.  If science was very specialized, then the specialization/division of labor argument makes sense.  But in the real world, it's not a question between poetry and math, it's a question between applying rational thought to chemistry/biology/physics or business, and most people who are capable of science are also capable of things that make more money.  \r\n\r\nExternal forces (like the government) are capable of affecting both problems:  they can find/fund good science teachers, and they can artificially reward science over business.  The reason politicians will screw up any attempt at doing either of those is because there is no measure for \"good\" science, so you don't know if a teacher is a good science teacher, and when you attract capable people headed for business and incapable people headed nowhere, you award degrees to all of them (and cause unemployment among PhDs).\r\n\r\nMy solution?

There is a myth that it's a function of enormous personal attributes. There's a myth that achieving wealth is a function of personal intelligence and energy and thus that the product of that intelligence and energy being wealth is the sole and exclusive possession of the person who developed and earned it. And that myth is so egregious. It's just egregious.(...)*\r\n\r\n*\"The individual wealth which is generated in this economy is, in my judgment, and I doubt that there is much that anyone could disagree with about this, is a function of the innovative businesses which are created as a result of federal research. But you understand that the people who benefit from that research get it free. (...) So, if somebody starts a software company or a biotechnology company, or even if somebody owns a building in downtown Washington which you rent to those people, it starts from the same place.

(Ironically, it ends with a quote from Lisp guy John McCarthy, seeing that reddit has lots of Lisp articles.)\r\n\r\nFor those who prefer the other ideological end of the spectrum, [Chomsky](http://www.lipmagazine.org/articles/featchomsky_63_p.htm) and [other leftists](http://www.counterpunch.org/schaefer08132003.html) analyze in detail these high-tech federal subsidies. With essentially the same conclusions as above, though claiming that there should have been more democratic control over where this spending went, as they probably consider people like Gates's son leeches. However, many claim that that some form of federal spending is vital for the economy, even in the form of military, as the economy would fail otherwise.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1139343800,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_1bqn","edited":false,"id":"c1byj","author":"tayssir","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473820978,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0}

Let's say there were two societies, A and B, that were roughly the same size. If society A had 10 violent crimes per year and society B had 100,000, then I don't think that most reasonable people would object to saying that society B was the more violent of the two. Scale does matter. \r\n\r\nSo please, let's not equivocate, let's condemn all violence.  If there happens to have been all kind of violence perpetrated by Muslims in the last few days, I don't see why we need to try and gloss over, or soften that fact by trying to grasp for incidents when Christians, or Jews, or Hindus, or whatever different religious groups people have been bringing up were violent.  I'll condemn those actions when they happen.  But let's face the present reality with honesty.\r\n\r\n\"Let go of the hate, man.\" Who do I hate?  If my response came across as hateful then I sincerely apologize. I am truly trying to keep all my comments as anti-cable-talk-show as I can.  \r\n\r\nI would never suggest that \"Muslims cannot have the same fears &amp; motivations\" as I do, only that they aren't currently reacting how I would.  Do you think I've never been religiously offended?  I have.  Did I react violently?  Not in the least.\r\n\r\nI believe that you are sincere in your reluctance to judge the mobs of offended, and sincerely committed, muslims. But I am not afraid to make a value judgement: Their ACTIONS (not their persons) are inferior to the way that western society would have reacted to the same stimuli.  Would there have been an angry reaction in the US if we took out Mohammed's face and put in Christ's? Yes.  Would there have been violence? Maybe.  Would it have remotely approached the level of violence going on now?  Of course not.  If you really believe otherwise, then I guess you and I will have to agree to disagree.

As I mentioned above, we're just too used to seeing incompetent politicians do it poorly, and we've lost hope that it could ever be done effectively.  If there were a big revolution and every state became an autonomous nation, for instance, you'd see many of them intervening in the market effectively for ten or twenty years (and then they would become corrupt too, because non-corrupt governments are inherently unstable.

{"body":"The general drift of comments is that these atrocities were somehow unprecendented and out of proportion, and there's no way to analyse it except to say \"islamofacists\". \r\n\r\nFirst we have to remember that this kind of violence is not too far from the surface of most societies (&amp; let's not get into homicide rates in the US!). You seem to agree there. Many people delude themselves about their own tribe's wisdom &amp; restraint. Myself included, as it turned out.\r\n\r\nI think the Muslim reaction is disproportionate. So the key question is \"why?\" I think it's being fueled by opportunists to tighten their hold on these people's will. Lord knows they have been told for decades about how evil the West is, and we haven't given them much reason to believe otherwise. There is a lot of pent-up anger \"over there\". It's not beyond comprehension. We are at a critical point in history.\r\n\r\nI was deeply insulted by the original article -- it is a clumsy screed that paints Muslims as irrational, violent ciphers who are out to get us. \"Us\" being the stalwart members of all other faiths who never (ha!) stoop to violence. It uses textbook call-to-arms rhetoric designed to provoke the reader. Our sacred beliefs are under attack! We must resist this threat! We must... oh. Why, that's *exactly what the imams are saying to the rioting Muslims*. You get it? It's a set-up.\r\n\r\nAfter the initial shock I got a another one -- the number of folk who were taken in by it. Irony-deficient people who have no clue about the world beyond the end of their nose... who apparently believe there are no Muslims living in Europe, or that this somehow justifies general war against Islam.\r\n\r\nThank you too.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_1aig","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1139356269,"author":"aristus","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_c1c0y","id":"c1c2k","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473820980}

However, there is a real cost, I've yet to find a hospital that actually knows what it is. The problem is concluding, for example, that a $5,000 a year real-costs social program is cheaper than a $25,000 a year medical bill. I don't know if it is, and I don't know if it isn't. I do know that I can't conclude that it is. :-) I still like the article, I just don't want people to think that the savings are that obvious."}

Does that really happen?  I seriously doubt anyone would be bothered to click through to a user's \"home\" page to determine this.  Based on my own behaviour on Reddit (admittedly not a good metric) I think many users tend to mod down any submitted link that is obviously a blog.  If it's hosted by Blogger, Typepad or even WordPress, forget about gaining Karma.\r\n\r\nWhy?  Well, there are enough blogs out there now to choke an elephant.  Do we really need another tech, political, or financial blog?  Many of them are just mutual admiration societies and quite incestuous.  Do I need to find out every day who Robert Scoble had dinner with the night before?  (I don't, but if you do you can mod those links up).  I think it's far more interesting when people completely outside of the geek and political world discover blogging:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.englishcut.com/\r\n\r\nWhat we need is a broadening of content and aggregation thereof.  Thankfully, this is starting to happen on Reddit: remember not so long ago (months?) when Reddit was primarly a Lisp/Python/Paul Graham/Guy Kawasaki link farm?  Not very interesting if you work in another realm or have other interests.  Things got better because the user base expanded: good scale.\r\n\r\nI disagree about the link on the user page, though.  If you're going to have Karma, it makes sense from a design POV  that it be Reddit-centric and based on the quality of the links you submit than the quality of your (offsite) weblog.  Of course, if you're well-known enough (Paul Graham, Joel Spolsky) you can obviate that by using your real name and probably generate some personality-based Karma.\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473820990,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"c1cmu","parent_id":"t1_c1cj1","author":"wyclif","author_flair_text":null}

No one has ever died from the mishandling of nuclear waste.  Ever.  And our disposal methods aren't hard, either.  The waste is sealed inside a cement cask and is cooled in a swimming pool for 18 months -- during which time the most dangerously radioactive elements decay into stuff that's safer to handle.  Then the casks are placed in a field and... sit there, doing nothing except raising the number of UV and X-ray photons slightly above the already-large number that arrive from the sun or from deep space every second.  Airline pilots &amp; flight crews get about the same amount of radiation exposure as the people who process these casks because they spend a lot of time outside the dense part of the atmosphere and closer to thoes emissions.  The average sailor on a nuclear submarine gets less exposure than either group, because he has an extra 1000 feet of densely-packed H20 molecules between him and the sky.\r\n\r\n2. No terrorists have ever even tried to steal nuclear waste -- they'd be better-advised to go after industrial chemicals instead (cyanides, As compounds, etc).  Security could easily be improved by shipping the waste to a central storage center, which hasn't happened because nuclear paranoia has forced us to pursue the embarassment at Yucca Mountain instead.\r\n\r\nThe decision isn't between \"nukes and fossils\" and \"nukes and renewables.\"  It's between technologies that work, technologies that *might* work on a large scale, and technologies that won't.  \"Nukes and fossils\" (and hydro) all work, and renewables don't yet -- show me a gigawatt wind farm that works for six hours a day, and I'll believe you.

All this isn't to say that python isn't very flexible, its one of the most powerful languages out there. Its just that the \"Have one and only one (right) way to do it\" design lets me put my programming ego at ease and get stuff done.\r\n\r\nI've used a number of languages over the years, but at last my desire to spend all my time learning every language under the sun has been satisfied.

Now I'm refusing to get distracted with the amazingness of every new language feature out there and instead am getting back to developing solutions to problems. This isn't to say that languages such as lisp dont have great appeal. But I will go so far to say that a major factor in the very academic oriented languages (scheme, hascal..) being used to create some of the greatest programs out there is that they simply attract the great minds.\r\n\r\nNow if your talking about writing a DSL for circumstances were it provides a clear advantage over existing languages then thats fine. Using metaprogramming to simplify your API, for example, is fine too. But spending all of your time focusing on programming your programming language instead using the language to solve the problem at hand will only get you so far.\r\n\r\nSo, languages can be tools, they can be toys.

Does your knee hurt when you jerk it like that?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would prefer you not lump all atheists together just as you (probably) prefer not to be lumped with all theists.  Some (myself included) are agnostic atheists.  Being agnostic means recognizing that the whole issue is not decidable (in essence).  In my opinion, belief and non-belief are on equal footing (or... lack of footing) in the grandest scheme.  However, I must admit that occasional(?) verifiably-false claims by religious folks (e.g., the earth is only 6000 years old), cause me to snicker a little (forgive me... won't you?) and feel that the error must be rooted in a deeper inability to see the true nature of things.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your comment that acting like a Christian is central to *being* a Christian (though I believe there are alternative views within Christian circles).  I dislike hypocrisy, certainly, but just because you'd like to disown the members of your group that do evil doesn't mean that those acts were not performed in the name of a God/doctrine/leader/scripture with whom your group is associated.\r\n\r\nFinally, I agree that the last passage you quote is arrogant and is (I think) also silly.

I imagine they'd do it again in the same circumstances.\r\n\r\nExecuting the handicapped may not *sound* very nice, but you can phrase it in such a way that most people would approve: \"executing a someone guilty of a heinous crime who just happens to be handicapped.\"  Either way, I don't think it's the fact that the criminal is handicapped that you're objecting to -- it's the idea that handicapped people are more likely to be innocent (hence, wrongfully convicted).  (pointed question: what is the implication for other protected classes like women or blacks?)\r\n\r\nIf that is your argument, it's misguided.  We might execute people wrongfully in America, but we never try to.  When it happens, people are appalled.  And it's ludicrous to suggest that Americans who support the execution of disabled people also support the execution of *disabled innocents*.  Now that the Supreme Court has handed down its decision, mentally handicapped convicts will be imprisoned instead of executed, and a few will still turn out to be innocent, in your formulation (\"no justice system can be perfect\").\r\n\r\nAmerican convicts can still hope for exculpation, or maybe a new trial.

It's more on a historical scale, like saying \"Rome used to be the center of the world, and during the Middle Ages fell into poverty and obscurity until the Renaissance.\"\r\n\r\nIt also points to the dysfunctional colonial rule(rs).

I've studied this phenomenon a bit.)\r\n\r\nI've noticed that dissidents get this question a lot, and have tried to explain it. Let's take Chomsky as an example, as he's among the most famous dissidents, maybe near as well-known as Michael Moore. When asked why he keeps blaming America, he explains that as a citizen in an unusually free nation where its citizens have fought their leaders for the rights to free speech, he feels a moral responsibility to speak out when he perceives the press hasn't done its job, and when the nation's leadership is committing horrendous acts.\r\n\r\nIn a dictatorship, he'd be largely absolved of blame, in his mind. However, US citizens are somewhere between a dictatorship and actual democracy. Therefore according to his moral calculus, he shoulders some portion of the blame for the US's actions.\r\n\r\nAnother part of his calculus is that as a \"fellow traveller\" with anarchists, he believes that authority has the responsibility to regularly justify itself. So in his worldview, the burden of proof is on those powerful enough to invade multiple nations, and large-scale international \"violence\" is among the most serious burden of proofs one can imagine.\r\n\r\nAnother thing he claims is that we like to talk about the bad things others do. However, he thinks we don't like looking in the mirror and focussing a fraction of that scrutiny on ourselves. So he claims that indeed Hussein and the Soviets were terrible (there were apparently even bans on linguistics in the Soviet Union because they didn't like him), but our main responsibility is to take care of what we can actually affect. Just as we expect Arabs to fix their own problems, he thinks we should do the same.\r\n\r\nNow, that's just one guy who many claim is an apologist for non-Americans. Other dissidents have different motivations, but we have to start somewhere, so we can actually scrutinize dissident thinking for flaws.","score":11,"ups":11,"created_utc":1139453679,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_c1d90","edited":false,"id":"c1da8","author":"tayssir","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473821003,"gilded":0}
